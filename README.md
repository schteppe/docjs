# jox
```jox``` maps comments in your source to custom HTML. The comments are written using JSDoc-style tags and Markdown syntax, and the HTML is rendered using your own EJS templates. This makes it possible to make super-customized documentation for your code.

### Install
```
git clone https://github.com/schteppe/jox.git;
cd jox;
npm install . -g
```

### Usage
#### 1. Document your code
Example:
```
/**
 * Computes the sum of two numbers.
 * @function
 * @param {number} a
 * @param {number} b
 * @return {number} The sum.
 */
function add(a,b) {
    return a+b;
}
```
Say you save this file as ```src/add.js```.

#### 2. Create an .ejs or .jade template
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    <h1>My first jox template</h1>
    <%
    for(var i=0; i<comments.length; i++){
        var c = comments[i]; %>
        <h2><%=c.ctx.name%></h2>
        <%-c.description.full%>
        <%
    }
    %>
</body>
</html>
```
For more information on how to write EJS templates, visit http://embeddedjs.com/. You can also use [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/).

In the template you have access to the ```comments``` array produced by [dox](https://github.com/visionmedia/dox), as well as a few nifty functions provided by jox. For more information about what information the ```comments``` contains, visit the [dox github page](https://github.com/visionmedia/dox).

Let's say you save the above file in your project folder as ```doc/template.ejs```.

#### 3. Create a file ```.jox``` in the root of your project folder
Example:
```
{
    "source"      : ["src/add.js"],
    "template"    : "doc/template.ejs",
    "destination" : "doc/index.html"
}
```
This instructs ```jox``` scan the JavaScript file of yours, use the template ```doc/template.ejs``` and produce a HTML file ```doc/index.html```.

#### 4. Run jox
```
jox
```
Done! Now you can view ```doc/index.html``` in a web browser. It will look something like this:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    <h1>My first template</h1>
    <h2>add</h2>
    <p>Computes the sum of two numbers.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Note: if you need external files for your HTML (css, javascript, images, etc.), you need to add them manually. In this case, they could have been placed in ```doc/```.

### Local variables in the template

#### comments : Array
The comments generated by [dox](https://github.com/visionmedia/dox). They are parsed from all files, one at a time, and concatenated in this ```comments``` array. jox adds a "file" property to each comment so you know where it was parsed.
```
[
  {
    "tags": [{ "type": "method", ... }, ... ],
    "description": { "full": "<p>some html</p>", ... },
    "code": "...",
    "ctx": { "type": "method", ... },
    "file":"src/filename.js"
  },
  ...
]
```
The other nifty things available inside the templates are described in the [sample documentation](doc/index.html).
